# Synthesis provider tool

This is a web application with a backend meant to demonstrate how the BioDesign Metadata can be used to by a synthesis provider
to review a design. The backend is a simple Flask application and the frontend is a single React page. The home page allows a user to
"order" the exported sequence and submit metadata from the BioDesign tool. If the metadata is not provided, the tool will ask for it.
